# RockThePatchv3

> *Developed by Patches 06/27/2015 - present*

##Reason 

https://github.com/isuPatches/RockThePatch was the original code base dating back to 2010/2011 and over the course of 
the years I have vastly improved my technical knowledge.  The original code base never considered OOPhp elements or visibility
correctly and I never set hard standards or used continuous integration/deployment tools.  Bottom line the cost to refactor 
that vast code base versus starting from scratch and enforcing standards from the start was too high so this is an official 
reboot.  This time I intend to write automated tests as I'm building as well.
